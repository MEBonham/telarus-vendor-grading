# 1.3-Hour Check-In
I have dummy data uploaded, and a consumer page where the star ratings for those vendors are processed and they are sorted by their final scores.

I need to:
- Make the full details of the scores and final-grade system display
- Call an AI to get reasonable explanation summaries of the final grades.
